# FullS-Cou
Hello, welcome to this giant huge repo and it is a little messy, but this is my go-to mini library of all the codes that I've learnt at the HCS. 
This is also my first-ever attempt with Github, whilst still learning as to be a fullstack web developer. 
Since I've graduated, you will find my other personal projects and coding practice in other repos.
